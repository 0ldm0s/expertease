This is the [MVP]() of the platform Expert-Ease: a [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) that connects users of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to experts that help them in real time. :nerd_face:
The full story of how this venture came to life can be found [here]().

 ## Introduction
 Users of many different [SAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) products and services have a hard time figuring out things on their own while using them for the first few times.
 Me and my team have seen this happen with multiple such products while researching the market, and have decided to focus on Wordpress, since the user base is large and the
 platform can be intimidating to new (or even intermediate) users.
 During the research, we have conducted a survey with a little over a hundred participants, including professional web developers and influencers in
 the Israeli startup scene, which showed that when people don't figure out the platforms, they first ask their friends and\or family or go
 to YouTube tutorials. We can clearly see people abandoning the customer support channels that those platform offer; in our case, it was
 mostly because of long waiting time.
 
 This is where **Expert-Ease** comes in; we wish to connect those users in search of support with experts on each platform, that will give them
 immediate, on-site, personal support with as little friction as possible.
 
 ## Techy details
 As said, I have decided to go on with a Telegram bot for the MVP. The reason is, I had to make a working prototype in a week or so, so I
 needed to utilize an existing platform, and Telegram seemed to have the simplest API.
 A detailed high level approach to the code can be found [here](), but other than that, I'd like to share with you a bit on the process
 this MVP (and me, along the way) went through.
 
 While structuring and developing the bot, I have ran into obstacles and challenges that were all new to me.
